# Lead Generation / Tech for Better Development

Welcome to the Tech for Better (TFB) lead generation. The purpose of this time, is to conduct horizon scanning for potential charities and NGOs which may have an interest in the TFB programme.

## Target outcomes

* Each person should aim to select at least five (ideally eight) organisations which may be applicable within the two hours.
* List the names and contact details of relevant people within the organisation which may be responsible for applying for TFB

### Finding an organisation

To find an organisation which may be interested in FAC TFB programme you can try: 

* Google.com
* https://charitybase.uk/
* LinkedIN

### Finding the relevant person to contact

Although the below will not apply in every case (especailly for smaller organisations), you should aim to email people with relevant job titles. As they will likely be the decision makers when deciding to apply for TFB. 

For example: 

* Tech Lead
* Technical Project Manager
* Project Manager
* Technical PM
* Programme Manager
* Scrum Master
* Agile Coach
* CTO
* Head of Development


### Finding the relevant contact details

Go to https://hunter.io/ and sign up for an account. 

Once signed up you can input the organisation's domain name into an input field and it will return the format of that organisation's email addresses. 

for example: 

* first.last@reallygreatcharity.org
*or*
* f.last@reallygreatcharity.org


### Putting it all together


If for example you wanted to reach out to "reallygreatcharity.org". 

1. First go to www.linkedin.com

2. In the search for company section input "reallygreatcharity".

3. Once on the reallygreatcharity main LinkedIN page click on the employees section.

4. Filter the result by country or city (England, London)

5. Scroll through the results and record the name of all employees which have the above job title (if you see any other employees with relevant job titles, record them as well).

6. Record all the information within the AirTable spreadsheet. (https://airtable.com/tbl3DC1Px3FZgqFI8/viwn3WR1LLKI5ptNx?blocks=hide).

7. Use https://hunter.io/ to figure out the format of the email address at "reallygreatcharity".

8. Once you have all the above information email **ONLY** two people from that organisation. It is important not to spam the organisation so please remember to only email two. The following cohort can email the other employees which you have recorded at a later dat if no response is received.

    8.1 For example, you see from the LinkedIN employees page that reallygreatcharity's technical project manager is Jane Doe. You kow from https://hunter.io/ that the format of emails address at that origisation is f.last@reallygreatcharity.org. Therefore to email Jane Doe you email j.doe@reallygreatcharity.org.

9. Email templates can be found here: https://github.com/foundersandcoders/tech-for-better-leads/tree/master/email-templates . Please be sure to use the target person's first name to make the email more personal.
