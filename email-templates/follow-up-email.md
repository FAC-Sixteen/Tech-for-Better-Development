[ Greeting ]

Thank you very much for your email, I am pleased to hear you are interested.

Here's some information about the process we hope can be of use:

Firstly, we think its important to note that we have a limited amount of developers available for projects - as such we cannot guarantee at this stage whether there would be a team available to work on your project. However even if there isn't a team available this time, we run this programme three times a year so there may be opportunities for it to happen in the future.

If there is a team available to work on your project they will be doing so full time over the period of [DATES]

We would need a representative from your organisation to attend a full day workshop on the [DATE] to determine what we will be building for you. We have found in the past that the most successful projects have been those with a strong, continuous line of communication between us and the client - so ideally there would be a point of contact at your organisation that we could be in correspondence with throughout this period.

We would aim to confirm whether there would be a team available to work on your project around two weeks before the above date.

If you feel the above arrangement would work for you, we usually suggest either coming in for a meeting or arranging a phone call. This would be for us to get as much information as possible about your charity and discuss what we might be able to help you with, in order to eventually determine whether we can take your project on.

If you let us know times that would be good for a meeting/phone call then we can get it scheduled in.

Kind regards,

[ Your Name ]
