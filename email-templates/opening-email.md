'Partnering with us'

Body
Dear Sir/Madam,

I am contacting you from Founders & Coders, a London based web-development course that specialises in tech for good by building free apps and other tech products for charities and NGOs. For our final projects, we partner with clients to design and build a prototype tech solution to solve a problem they have identified in their work. This process is entirely free for the client.

Previously our students have worked with a variety of organisations such as Child Line, Quaker Social Action and the Anna Freud Centre to develop a number of projects. Examples of previous projects and details of our student program can be found here:

If this is something your organisation would be interested in, please let us know how to reach you and a good time to call, so that we can have a chat about the process and how we might be able to help you.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch if you would like any more information.

Kind regards,

[Your name]
