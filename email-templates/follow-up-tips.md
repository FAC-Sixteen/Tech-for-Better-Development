Some Thoughts on Client Follow-up:

I was asked to put together some advice for client follow-up. Some of these things may be obvious. Some things may be missing. Please feel free to ask any questions, no matter how small.

It’s natural to feel nervous before a phone call or meeting. Don’t worry about it. Try to practice with a friend or even just take a deep breath and smile before you get on a call.

Don’t talk too quickly. Try and be relaxed and comfortable.

Briefly introduce yourself and the organization if you have not yet done so. People want to know who they are talking to (but they don’t need your life story).

Try to put yourself in the client’s shoes, but with an optimistic attitude. That means think about what they don’t know, what they might want to know, but presume they will be interested. Presume you have something of value to offer.

Be prepared to ask the client questions. Show interest in their work. Have a conversation about how our work might fit in with their work. Don’t make it a one-sided pitch.

If the client asks a question and you don’t know the answer, don’t feel embarrassed if you don’t know. Just say you don’t know but will follow-up.
